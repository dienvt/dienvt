👋 Hi, I'm Điền. I'm a software engineer which also known as "dev cỏ" in my language.

cỏ: 
+ negavive mean: grass, no value and can find anywhere
+ positive mean: the plant that make you high


I pretty good at swimming. Did you know why? because i alway let the water raise over my head. 🏊‍♂️🏊‍♂️🏊‍♂️

I also love running (run from my responsibility. 🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️🏃‍♂️)
